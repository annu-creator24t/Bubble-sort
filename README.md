Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process continues until the list is sorted. It has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(nÂ²) and is not suitable for large datasets.
